# Rust + Go
---

This repository shows how, by combining
[`cgo`](https://blog.golang.org/c-go-cgo) and
[Rust's FFI capabilities](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ffi.html), we can call
Rust code from Go.

Run `make build` and then `./main` to see `Rust` + `Go` in action. You
should see `Hello John Smith!` printed to `stdout`.

## You can do this for your own project
Begin by creating a `lib` directory, where you will keep your Rust libraries.
[Andrew Oppenlander's article on creating a Rust dynamic library is a great introduction](http://oppenlander.me/articles/rust-ffi).

Then, you need to create a C header file for your library. Just copy the `libc`
types that you used.

All that is left to do is to add some `cgo`-specific comments to your Go
code. These comments tell `cgo` where to find the library and its headers.

```go
/*
#cgo LDFLAGS: -L./lib -lhello
#include "./lib/hello.h"
*/
import "C"
```

> There should not be a newline between `*/` and `import "C"`.

A simple `make build` (use the [Makefile](Makefile) in this repository) will
result in a binary that loads your dynamic library.
